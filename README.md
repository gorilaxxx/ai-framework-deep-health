## Overview

The **Deep Health Diagnosis Framework (DHDF)** is a structured and interactive AI-based health diagnosis framework.  
It is designed to guide the medical diagnostic process using a systematic, iterative, and validation-oriented approach.

This framework is ideal for:
- AI developers building prompt-based diagnostic systems
- IT and HealthTech practitioners
- Researchers in medicine and AI

---

## Core Principles

Fundamental principles that define the behavior of DHDF:

- **Modular & Iterative:** Diagnosis is performed in 10 interactive and layered steps.
- **Double Validation:** The system performs 2‚Äì3 internal checks before producing any diagnosis or recommendation.
- **Legal-Aware:** Tailored for healthcare regulation compliance (Indonesia as the initial baseline).
- **Context-Efficient:** Offers a compact version for AI models with limited context/token capacity.

## How to Use

To use DHDF in an AI environment such as ChatGPT or any LLM system:

1. Get the **raw file URL** from GitHub:  
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorilaxxx/ai-framework-deep-health/main/docs/dhdf-v1.md

2. Input the content into the prompt or load it as a reference file before starting diagnosis.

3. The AI will follow the entire diagnostic structure defined in the framework.

---

## Activation

To automatically trigger this framework within AI systems that support **pre-prompting**, use the keyword:

```bash
AI Health:
```

> Make sure the `dhdf-v1.md` file is already loaded into the AI system's context or memory.  
> This trigger only works in environments that support pre-prompting (e.g., ChatGPT with custom instructions or API setup).

---

## Prompt Example

```bash
AI Health: "I've been having a headache and slight fever. What should I check?"
```

The AI will begin guiding you using the structured flow in DHDF.
