## 📐 Code and Structure Guidelines

- Follow the folder structure strictly:

```bash
ai-framework-deep-health/
├── docs/
│   ├── dhdf-v1.md
│   ├── esa-reflection.md
│   ├── dhdf-flowchart.mmd
│   └── examples/
│       ├── flu-diagnosis.md
│       └── mild-gad-esa-reflection.md
├── AUTHORS.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── index.md
```

- Do not modify existing core files without discussion.
- Use descriptive filenames in `examples/` (e.g., `mild-gad-esa-reflection.md`).
- Mermaid diagrams should remain valid and renderable.
- English is preferred for all documentation, but respectful contextual notes in Bahasa Indonesia are allowed where helpful.

---

## 📎 Notes

- This project values **spiritual depth**, **technical accuracy**, and **emotional clarity**.
- Do not submit content that contradicts the core Tauhidic philosophy embedded in the Esa Framework.
- All reflections should preserve integrity, compassion, and coherence with the idea of *The Absolute Presence*.
- If unsure about anything, open an **Issue** or start a **Discussion** first before making major changes.

Let’s build something meaningful — together.

✨ *With Presence and Purpose.*
