# Flu Diagnosis Example (DHDF v1)

> This file provides a practical example of how the **Deep Health Diagnosis Framework (DHDF)** can be applied to a simple case of flu-like symptoms.  
> The goal is to demonstrate **interactive communication**, **iterative logic**, and **risk validation** embedded in DHDF.

---

## 1. Case Initiation

**User Complaint:**
> "I’ve been feeling unwell for the last three days. I have a sore throat, slight fever, and my body aches."

---

## 2. Initial Clarification

**System:**  
> Are these symptoms consistent every day, or have they been improving or worsening?

**User:**  
> They've stayed pretty much the same.

---

## 3. Context & Symptom Identification

- **Primary Symptoms:**
  - Sore throat
  - Mild fever (estimated < 38.5°C)
  - Body ache
- **Duration:** 3 days
- **No high-risk exposure** reported
- **No travel history** or contact with known COVID patients

---

## 4. Follow-up Questions & Risk Collection

**System:**  
> Do you have difficulty breathing or chest pain?

**User:**  
> No, just congestion and fatigue.

**System:**  
> Any chronic illness such as asthma, diabetes, or hypertension?

**User:**  
> No.

## 5. Risk Factor Summary

| Risk Factor            | Status     |
|------------------------|------------|
| Chronic illness        | None       |
| High fever             | No         |
| Shortness of breath    | No         |
| Duration > 5 days      | No         |
| COVID contact          | No         |

## 6. Temporary Diagnosis Mapping

**Logical Assumption:**
- Probable viral infection, most likely **seasonal flu**.

---

## 7. High-Risk Symptom Check

- No signs of:
  - Respiratory distress
  - Cyanosis
  - Severe dehydration
  - Confusion or disorientation

**→ Risk: LOW**

---

## 8. Legal & Ethical Check

- The current case is within DHDF’s **AI diagnostic support scope**.
- No escalation needed.

---

## 9. Summary & Suggestion

**Preliminary Diagnosis:**  
> Likely **influenza-like viral infection** (mild severity)

**Suggestions:**
- Get proper rest, hydration
- Monitor temperature daily
- Take over-the-counter fever reducers (e.g., paracetamol)
- If symptoms persist beyond 5–7 days or worsen, consult a doctor

## 10. Optional Reflection (Esa Framework)

> Would you like a deeper personal reflection based on the **Esa Framework** to explore how your health connects with your life balance and consciousness?

If yes, [see esa-reflection.md](../esa-reflection.md)
