## Logging & Audit
Each step in the diagnosis process is logged internally to ensure:
- **Quality Control:** Maintains high standards in diagnostic procedures.
- **Professional Auditing:** Facilitates review by medical professionals.
- **Decision-Making Transparency:** Provides clear rationale for diagnostic decisions.

After the medical diagnosis is delivered, users have the option to engage in a **non-clinical spiritual reflection** through the **Esa Framework**. This path aims to:
- **Provide Spiritual Support:** Offers insights from a spiritual perspective.
- **Enhance Self-Awareness:** Assists users in understanding their health in a broader context.
- **Maintain Separation from Clinical Diagnosis:** Does not influence the medical diagnosis or treatment plan.
